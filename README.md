# Project - Pomodoro Timer
A productivity/time management timer that allows the user to create study session intervals broken by breaks.

## Context of Assignment
This assignment proceeding my first learning of React. This assignment was meant to test my knowledge of react components and use state.

## Features of Project
![Pomodoro Timer Screenshot](/images/pomodorotimer.jpg)
In this application, the user is allowed to set their timer for their break and study times. When the user clicks "Play" a progress bar showing the amount of time remaining is displayed. Also, when play is clicked, the stop button is enabled.

## Technologies used
- React (JSX)
- JavaScript

## Learnings form this Project
This project forced me to become a little more confident with React, especially the useState hook. The focus and break durations and countdown time were all states that needed be changed upon click. 

## Future Goals for this Project
I have no future goals for this project, but I can see this project being applied to a suite of learning tools that help learners be successful. Another tool that would be added to this suite, would be the flash cards app. See my [Project Flashcards](https://github.com/benjamin-gates/project-flashcards) for an example of this.
